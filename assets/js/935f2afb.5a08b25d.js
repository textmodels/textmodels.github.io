This allows team members to make separate changes simultaneously without disrupting the master documentation and ensures that the master branch always contains accepted (or approved) documentation. Feature branches should be given descriptive names and can be pushed to a central repository to be shared with others and backed up. The master branch is the only \\"special\\" branch and it is not affected by the creation or deletion of feature branches. This is a huge advantage as it encourages incremental and controlled changes because the changes can be merged with the master branch individually as they are ready.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial-extras/setting-repository-settings":{"id":"tutorial-extras/setting-repository-settings","title":"Configure repository settings","description":"Select the menu Repository > Settings to open the dialog for the repository settings.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
